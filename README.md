# openisms
OpenISMS is a tool for information security managers. The goal is to create one single tool for the governance of information security. The first step is to implement a risk assessment tool inspired by OCTAVE Allegro.

The following milestones are planned: 
v0.01: Data structure is defined in JSON and example files are established.
v0.02: Webserver running on Flask is established. 
v0.03: It is possible to add a new service to the risk assessment.
v0.04: It is possible to delete a service from the risk assessment.
v0.05: It is possible to add a new risk aspect to each service.
v0.06: It is possible to delete existing aspects from each service.
v0.07: It is possible to edit service attributes.
v0.10: It is possible to edit existing risk aspects attributes.
